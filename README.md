## üìù Description
Welcome to my project! Here's a brief overview of what inspired me to create it, the problem it solves, and what I've learned throughout its development:


Motivation:
My blind cousin struggled to navigate Netflix with his screen reader, unable to choose his favorite series. This issue is widespread among vision-impaired Australians, who face digital accessibility challenges. According to [Vision Australia](https://www.visionaustralia.org/business-consulting/digital-access/assistive-technology-survey/overview), many assistive technologies fall short.

To address this, I developed an AI agent that accepts chat inputs, offering a seamless user experience. Vision-impaired users can now navigate and select entertainment through natural chat commands and audio feedback.
By enhancing accessibility, we can bridge the digital divide and bring joy to everyone. Let's innovate to make the world more inclusive and accessible for all.


Why I Built This Project: I wanted to develop a practical, user-friendly, and production-ready MVP to solve this pressing problem.

Problem Solved: This project improves accessibility for vision-impaired users and demonstrates the capabilities of AI agents.

What I Learned: Throughout the development process, I learned:



      - Frontend Development: React, Material UI
      - State Management: Redux, Redux Toolkit, Context API
      - Styling: Material UI
      - Backend Integration: Axios, Redux Toolkit
      - Unit and Integration Testing: React Testing Library, JEST
      - End-to-End (E2E) Testing: Cypress
      - API Testing - Postman
      - CI/CD Pipelines: GitHub Actions, AWS
      - Containerization: Docker
      - Deployment: Nginx, AWS EC2, Route 53
      - Build Tools: Create React App
      - Linting and Code Quality: ESLint
      - AI Development: Creating AI agents using Alan AI
      - OS : Linux, Windows
      - Lines of Code - 2,815
