## üìù Description
Welcome to my project! Here's a brief overview of what inspired me to create it, the problem it solves, and what I've learned throughout its development:

Motivation: My blind cousin had trouble choosing his favorite series on Netflix because his screen reader couldn‚Äôt handle logical instructions. This is a common problem for vision-impaired Australians. ([Vision Australia](https://www.visionaustralia.org/business-consulting/digital-access/assistive-technology-survey/overview)). I created an AI agent that accepts both audio and video inputs to help address this issue.

Why I Built This Project: I wanted to develop a practical, user-friendly, and production-ready MVP to solve this pressing problem.

Problem Solved: This project improves accessibility for vision-impaired users and demonstrates the capabilities of AI agents.

What I Learned: Throughout the development process, I learned:



      - Frontend Development: React, Material UI
      - State Management: Redux, Redux Toolkit, Context API
      - Styling: Material UI
      - Backend Integration: Axios, Redux Toolkit
      - Unit and Integration Testing: React Testing Library, JEST
      - End-to-End (E2E) Testing: Cypress
      - API Testing - Postman
      - CI/CD Pipelines: GitHub Actions, AWS
      - Containerization: Docker
      - Deployment: Nginx, AWS EC2
      - Build Tools: Create React App
      - Linting and Code Quality: ESLint
      - AI Development: Creating AI agents using Alan AI
